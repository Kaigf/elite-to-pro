The prices listed on the Services do not guarantee those purchase prices until payment is made. If an incorrect price for a product is listed due to typographical or other error, ETP has the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for such products listed at the incorrect price, whether or not the order has been confirmed or your credit card charged.

ETP reserves the right to discontinue or modify any subscription fee payment option. If we discontinue or modify a subscription payment option, we will provide notice of such discontinuance or modification. You must affirmatively consent to the new payment terms in order to continue receiving the Subscription Services. If you do not affirmatively consent, your subscription will be cancelled. In addition, if you are signing up under any promotional subscription fee, some additional restrictions may apply. These restrictions, if any, will be provided to you before you sign up for the applicable Subscription Service that is subject to the promotion.</p>

Your access to the Subscription Services will not be established until ETP has verified that the credit card or other payment information you provide ETP for payment is accurate and that your payment method account is in good standing.</p>
<p>You further agree that ETP may charge any other applicable fees for the Service, including any early termination fee, to your payment method.</p>

<p>ETP reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to any Subscription Service that is a part of the ETP Service without notice upon rejection of any charges or if your payment method (or its agent or affiliate) seeks return of payments previously made to ETP when ETP believes you are liable for the charges.</p>

<p>When you make a purchase on the Service, you have immediate access to and use of the Services you have purchased. Accordingly, you lose your right to cancel once you have made your purchase and we do not offer any refunds or credits, including fees for Subscription Services.”</p>

<p>15. Miscellaneous: This Agreement (which hereby incorporates by reference any other provisions applicable to use of the Services , including, but not limited to, any supplemental terms governing the use of certain specific material contained on the Website and any operating rules for the Services established by ETP) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed severable, and the unenforceability of any one or more provisions will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions. In addition, if any provision of the Agreement, for any reason, is declared to be unenforceable, the parties will substitute an enforceable provision that, to the maximum extent possible under applicable law, preserves the original intentions and economic positions of the parties. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Seattle, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Notwithstanding this, you agree that ETP may still apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.  The failure by ETP to partially or fully exercise any rights or the waiver of any breach of this Agreement by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by us or be deemed a waiver by ETP of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of this Agreement.  ETP’s rights and remedies under this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit ETP’s right to exercise any other right or remedy.</p>
